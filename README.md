Cyber-Physical System Design Project
==================

In this project, we designed an autonomous vehicle that has the following functions:

1. The vehicle can detect the lanes through the external camera and adjust the direction, keeping itself moving between the lanes.
2. The vehicle can detect the front obstacle and adjust the speed, avoiding the collision.

skills used:Simulink,Python,System Model Design,etc.
